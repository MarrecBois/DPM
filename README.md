Code for our team's robot in ECSE211 - Design Principles and Methods. 

Our robot's mission is to traverse a makeshift 'dog park' using various sensors (color sensor, ultrasonic sensor) to navigate and clean up all of the dog poop found in the park.
It must sense and avoid water (blue ground) while searching for small foam cubes, which represent either people/benches (purple or green cubes), or dog poop (yellow/orange) cubes.
The final implementation of our robot's code can be found in mobility/final_integration.py.
